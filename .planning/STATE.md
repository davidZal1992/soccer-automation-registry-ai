# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Baileys for WhatsApp: Free, supports group management, message editing, admin controls
- Claude for Hebrew parsing: Best Hebrew support among LLMs, handles casual/typo text well
- 3-minute collection window: Handles registration burst at 12:00 without per-message template updates
- User ID mapping for cancellations: Players don't always write their name when cancelling — ID lookup is more reliable
- Ignore non-tagged messages in Group 1: Avoids wasting LLM tokens on general admin chat
